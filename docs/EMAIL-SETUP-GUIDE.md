# ðŸ“§ EmailJS Setup Guide for The Up And Up Chess Club

## Overview
This guide will help you set up reliable email confirmations for your chess club enrollment forms using EmailJS. This replaces the unreliable FormSubmit service with a professional email delivery system.

## What You've Got
âœ… **EmailJS integration** added to both enrollment forms  
âœ… **Centralized configuration** file for easy management  
âœ… **Backup systems** in place (Edge Function + FormSubmit fallbacks)  
âœ… **Professional email templates** with chess club branding  

## Quick Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to [emailjs.com/signup](https://www.emailjs.com/signup/)
2. Sign up for a **free account** (200 emails/month)
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Connect Your Email Service
1. In your EmailJS dashboard, click **"Add New Service"**
2. Choose your email provider:
   - **Gmail** (recommended)
   - Outlook
   - Yahoo
   - Other SMTP services
3. Follow the connection wizard
4. **Important for Gmail users:** You may need to:
   - Enable "2-step verification" in your Google account
   - Create an "App password" specifically for EmailJS
   - Use the app password instead of your regular password

### Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Click **"Create Email Template"** in EmailJS dashboard
2. **Template Settings:**
   - **Template Name:** `Chess Club Enrollment Confirmation`
   - **Subject:** `{{subject}}`
   - **Content:** Copy and paste this template:

```
Hello {{to_name}},

{{message}}

Best regards,
{{from_name}}

Email: theuauchessclub@gmail.com

This email was sent from our enrollment system.
```

3. Save the template and note the **Template ID**

### Step 4: Get Your Credentials
You need three pieces of information:

1. **Service ID** - Find this on your "Email Services" page
2. **Template ID** - Find this on your email template page  
3. **Public Key** - Find this in Account â†’ API Keys

### Step 5: Update Configuration File
1. Open the file `emailjs-config.js` in your project
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```javascript
window.CHESS_CLUB_EMAIL_CONFIG = {
    publicKey: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE',    // Replace this
    serviceId: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SERVICE_ID_HERE',    // Replace this  
    templateId: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_TEMPLATE_ID_HERE',  // Replace this
    
    // Leave these settings as they are
    fromName: 'The Up And Up Chess Club',
    replyToEmail: 'theuauchessclub@gmail.com',
    // ... rest of the configuration
};
```

### Step 6: Test Your Setup
1. Open the `emailjs-test.html` file
2. Enter your EmailJS credentials
3. Send a test email to hall.truth@gmail.com
4. Check your inbox (and spam folder)

## Troubleshooting

### "Email not received"
1. **Check spam folder** - New senders often go to spam initially
2. **Verify credentials** - Make sure all three IDs are correct
3. **Check EmailJS quota** - Free plan has 200 emails/month limit
4. **Gmail users:** Ensure app password is used, not regular password

### "EmailJS not working"
1. **Browser console** - Check for error messages (F12 â†’ Console)
2. **Test manually** - Use the emailjs-test.html tool
3. **Template variables** - Ensure template has {{to_name}}, {{subject}}, {{message}}
4. **Service connection** - Verify email service is properly connected

### "Form submits but no email"
- Form submission continues to work even if email fails
- Check browser console for EmailJS error messages
- Backup systems (Edge Function, FormSubmit) may still send emails

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- âœ… `enroll-private.html` - Added EmailJS integration
- âœ… `enroll-group.html` - Added EmailJS integration  
- âœ… `emailjs-config.js` - Centralized configuration file
- âœ… `emailjs-test.html` - Testing and setup tool

### Email Delivery Priority:
1. **EmailJS** (most reliable, immediate)
2. **Supabase Edge Function** (backup, may have API key issues)
3. **FormSubmit** (fallback, occasional delivery issues)

### Security Notes:
- EmailJS public key is safe to include in client-side code
- No sensitive passwords are stored in your website files
- Email authentication happens on EmailJS servers
